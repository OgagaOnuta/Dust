Python is an Object Oriented Language
meaning that everything in Python can be treated as objects,
everything is on a First-Class level
from variables, to functions, to classes, to objects, to methods,
to types, to integers, floats, whatever you can think of...


Python is a interpreted language


Statements in Python don't have a closing, unlike C
Variables do not need to be initialized,
they can just be declared and assigned values
>>> var = "value"

Functions, Loops, Control and Conditional statements
all end with a colon (:)
>>> if x >= 0:
>>>     return True

>>> for i in range(5):
>>>     print(i)

Statements in Python have to be indented
to show which statements belongs to which
as seen above
