# JAVASCRIPT ESSENTIALS 1

## Module 1. INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING

### Section 1 - About JavaScript

JavaScript is an **interpreted programming language**. It is also a high-level
language (i.e. relatively easy to understand for people and separating us from
the hardware details).

**node.js** is an interpreter, installed independently in the computer's
operating system. Using node.js allows you to write programs in JavaScript.

Most modern JavaScript engines use the _Just In Time Compilation_ technique
(_JIT Compilation_). This technique consists of compiling code fragments during
the execution of the program and allows you to increase its performance.

Steps in Writing a Program:

* Define the problem
* Find the optimal solution
* Write a program in the chosen language

The solution we propose and write in the form of a program must be 100%
unambiguous (as the computer cannot guess anything).

_Brendan Eich (1995)_ developed _LiveScript_, now known as _JavaScript_.

The use of JavaScript on websites is called _client-side_ programming. The code
to be executed is loaded together with the page in the browser, on the user's
side, and the interpreter which is a part of the web browser allows for its
execution.
